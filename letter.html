        <div class="header">O my Beloved Sweetness,</div>
        <div class="content">
            Happy Birthday to the most extraordinary woman I have ever had the privilege to know. On this special day, I want to take a moment to celebrate not just your birth, but the sheer brilliance of your existence. Your beauty, both inside and out, is a marvel that I am endlessly in awe of.

           <br><br> When I think of your beauty, words seem to fall short, but let me try to capture a fraction of it. Your radiance rivals the moon on a clear night, its silvery glow nowhere near as captivating as the light in your eyes. Just as the moon casts a gentle, luminous touch across the world, you illuminate my life with your presence. Your smile, like moonlight, is soft yet powerful, warming the coldest of hearts and turning even the darkest of days into something magical.
            
            In the realm of the seasons, you embody the grace of winter and the vibrance of spring. <br><br>Like winter’s first snowfall, your beauty is serene and enchanting, bringing peace and wonder to all who behold it. Yet, with the arrival of spring, you burst forth in a symphony of color and vitality, a testament to the joy and renewal you bring into my life. Each season is made more beautiful because you exist within it, adding depth and splendor to the world around us.
            
            If I were to compare you to the ocean, it would be with the deepest, most beautiful blue.<br><br> The way you navigate life with such grace and strength is reminiscent of the ocean’s boundless expanse. Just as the waves whisper secrets and caress the shore with endless affection, your presence in my life is a gentle reminder of the vast, endless beauty of love and devotion. Your essence, like the ocean, is both soothing and awe-inspiring, a force that moves me profoundly.
            
            The galaxies, with their swirling stars and celestial wonders, pale in comparison to the magnificence you embody.<br><br> Each star in the sky could never match the sparkle in your eyes, nor could any constellation align with the extraordinary path you create simply by being you. Your beauty is a universe unto itself, vast and infinite, filled with the kind of wonder that makes me feel as though I am exploring the cosmos each time I gaze at you.
            
            You are the constellation of my dreams, the North Star guiding me through life’s journey.<br><br> Your light, both bright and gentle, leads me with a love that transcends the ordinary, making every moment with you a precious treasure. I am eternally grateful for the chance to share this life with you, to witness the remarkable beauty that you bring into the world and into my heart.
            
            On this day, I want you to know that you are cherished beyond measure. <br><br>Your beauty, both seen and felt, is a gift that fills my life with joy and wonder. I hope today is as special and as wonderful as you are, my love. Happy Birthday to the most incredible woman I have ever known. May your day be filled with the same beauty and magic that you bring into my life every day.
            
            <br><br>O priye, mein jitni bhi tumhari prashansha kar lu mein kabhi tumhare uss param saudarya jo ki sharir se bahut pare hai , usse kabhi bhi nyay nahi kar paunga. Tum mere liye mera sabu kuch ho , mere swash se lekear mere pran tak , mere wartamaan se lekar mere bhawisya tak , mein tumme mein mera sarwashwa dekhta hun. 
            
            Ek tum hee toh ho jo purn taha meri ho . <br><br>tumhare bina mein apne astitwa ki kalpana bhi nahi kar sakta. Swarg ke adhipati Indra ke bhi itne bhagya nahi ki oh aapke hotho ko chum sake . Aap devi hein meri , aap aradhya hein meri , aap mere liye woh kalpana hein jo manushya ko pashu se manushya banati hein.
            
            Jab tumse pehli baar mila tha tab ye socha nahi tha ki janmo janmo ka nata jud jayega tumse . <br><br>But mughe atyant prashnnata hain ki mein tumhara hun. Mnn toh karta hai ki tumhari godd mein yun hee jiwan bhar leta rahu. tumhare bahon mein hee sama jaun . O priye mere pura sharir , mera pura jivan , mera samproon astitwa kewal tumhe samarpit hein. 
            
            <br><br>Even if it is your birthday but You are such a precious gift, and I will forever be thankful for the chance to share my life with you.
            
            Every day, when I look at you, my eyes fill with tears – not of sorrow, but of joy and gratitude.<br><br> Each moment spent with you, every second of our time together, brings my heart a level of happiness and peace that words cannot fully express. You have come into my life and made every single day so much more wonderful that I consider myself incredibly fortunate.
            
            <br><br>I thank every gods and every celestials being for bringing you into my life. The chance to meet you, to be with you, and to share this journey with you is a blessing I treasure beyond measure. You are my dream come true, the embodiment of everything I have ever hoped for and more.
            
            Your presence in my life is a constant reminder of how extraordinary it is to find someone so perfect.<br><br> I am endlessly grateful for every smile, every touch, and every moment we share. You are my everything, and I will always cherish and honor the gift of you.
            
            Thank you for being my partner, my confidant, and my greatest love.<br><br> I am beyond blessed to have you by my side. On your special day, I want you to know just how deeply I love you and how grateful I am that you are mine. Thank you for being mine jaan meri.
            
            <br><br>Aise hee sadewa mere sath rehna priye . tumhare prem pe hee mera jeewan chalta hai .......mughe sadewa tumhara he banke rehna hein.
